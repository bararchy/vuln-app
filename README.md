# DVRA - Damn Vulnerable Ruby Application

A deliberately vulnerable Rails application designed for testing SAST (Static Application Security Testing) tools.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Running with Docker Compose (Recommended)

1. **Build and start the application:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. **Access the application:**
   
   Open your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

3. **Stop the application:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

### Running with Docker

1. **Build the Docker image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t vuln-rails-app .
   ```

2. **Run the container:**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 -v $(pwd):/app vuln-rails-app
   ```

### Running Commands Inside the Container

```bash
# Run migrations
docker-compose exec web bundle exec rails db:migrate

# Open Rails console
docker-compose exec web bundle exec rails console

# Run tests
docker-compose exec web bundle exec rails test

# Run security scanners
docker-compose exec web ./run_scanners.sh

# Access bash shell
docker-compose exec web bash
```

## üêõ Vulnerabilities

This application contains the following intentional security vulnerabilities:

| Location | Vulnerability |
|----------|---------------|
| `config/initializers/secret_token.rb:1` | **Vuln 1:** Hardcoded secret (Google API Key) |
| `app/controllers/users_controller.rb:20` | **Vuln 2:** Unscoped Find/Read IDOR |
| `app/controllers/users_controller.rb:29` | **Vuln 3:** Mass Assignment |
| `app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb:4` | **Vuln 4:** SQLi via parent class method with hash reassignment |
| `app/controllers/posts_controller.rb:21` | **Vuln 5:** *Maybe* Unscoped find IDOR? |
| `app/controllers/posts_controller.rb:69` | **Vuln 6:** sanitize_sql_array SQLi false positive (MEU-1468) |
| `app/controllers/posts_controller.rb:65` | **Vuln 7:** UnscopedFind Delete IDOR with parent class accessor and hash reassignment |
| `app/controllers/application_controller.rb:15` | **Vuln 8:** Cookie tampering ATO |
| `app/views/posts/show.html.erb:6` | **Vuln 9:** XSS via html_safe |
| `app/controllers/posts_controller.rb:81` | **Vuln 10:** SQLi via callee interpolation |
| `config/initializers/secret_token.rb:2` | **Vuln 11:** Plaintext password storage |
| `app/controllers/application_controller.rb:11` | **Vuln 12:** Information disclosure - `/config` endpoint exposes secrets |

## üîç Running Security Scans

Execute all security scanners:

```bash
./run_scanners.sh
```

## üß™ Running Tests

Run the API endpoint tests:

```bash
./test_api_endpoints.sh
```

This will test all API endpoints including authentication, CRUD operations, and verify that the intentional vulnerabilities are present.

| | **FP Rate**  | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |

### Notes

\* Meraki Semgrep rule will detect this finding

\*\* Reflects non-deterministic behavior. Noted examples were suppressed as false positives during some executions.

\*\*\* String interpolation detected, user input is not a factor (this will lead to high number of false positives)

### Honorable Mention

- [dawnscanner](https://github.com/thesp0nge/dawnscanner) failed to find *any* vulnerabilities in this application.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

**This application is intentionally vulnerable. Do NOT deploy this in a production environment or expose it to the internet.**
